                        <p>We are a family based business in the UK and are very passionate about growing vegetables at home and on the allotment. We think everyone should give it a go especially with our little ones, encouraging them to eat healthy whilst enjoying an outdoor activity. Seeding Square is here to make this process simple for growers at all levels. Seeding Square as used in the square foot gardening method optimises space so efficiently users get upto 2-5 times the harvest, leaving no space for weeds. Our aim is to ensure every school in the UK will benefit from a seeding square in the near future so please spread the word and happy growing.</p>
